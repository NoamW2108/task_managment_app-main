# Basic Task Management App

A basic task manager built with Flutter that lets you add, complete, and track tasks — with history, QR sharing, and save local data via Hive.

## Features

- **Add & Manage Tasks**  
  Create new tasks, mark them as done, or delete them.

- **History View**  
  Completed tasks are moved to a history list so you can review what you’ve finished.

- **Task Statistics**  
  - Tasks remaining  
  - Tasks completed  
  - Total tasks (excluding deleted)

- **QR Code Sharing**  
  Scan a QR code to receive a text summary of:  
  - Tasks remaining to be completed
  - Tasks you’ve completed

- **Data storage**  
  Log in and log out — your tasks and history are saved locally using Hive, so nothing is lost when you close the app.
